# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Homework Description

Purpose of this assignment was to refactor an exsiting marketing agency's website using accessibility standards as well as ensuring that the webpage utilizes semantic elements in place of non-semantic elements.

The HTML file will get updated with necessary semantic elements while also fixing incorrectly linked elements, adding alt accesibility attributes and consolidating some code.

The CSS file will get appropriate updates to reflect the semantic element updates being utilized in the HTML file. CSS selectors can also be consolidated with comments before each element.
